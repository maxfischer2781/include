include - Dynamic Module Importer
#################################

When you just need that code, ``include`` does the ugly bits for you.
It allows you to run code from files, strings or other sources as if they were regular modules.
Code is executed as compliant as possible with the Python ecosystem.
The resulting modules and objects can be pickled, copied and sent to other processes.
